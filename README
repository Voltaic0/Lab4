Q1 and Q2:
//to compile os
cd one-level
cd os
make clean
make

//to compile makeprocs (from one-level directory)
cd apps
cd example
make clean
make
make run
//The six tests for Q2 should print successively and print out descriptive information to the terminal that proves the successful test cases.
//Except for test 2 because this will kill the process

/* The following is the output for test 2 when the virtual address is out of bounds 
   //invalidAddress needs to be (MEM_MAX_VIRTUAL_ADDRESS + 1) in test2.c, right now it is (MEM_MAX_VIRTUAL_ADDRESS - 3) so that it doesn't stop the other tests from running

    makeprocs (31): Test 2, Attempting to access outside of max bounds
    makeprocs (31): Creating process #5
    ProcessFork: stackframe = 0x29ea8
    Attempting to access past MAX Virtual Address (25): test2
    Attempting to access address: 1048576 (program should print error illegal access!)
    Exiting after illegal access at iar=0x11ec, isr=0x100
    Exiting at program request.
